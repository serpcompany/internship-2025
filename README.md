# SERP - Internship 2025
Welcome to the SERP Internship!

The repository & project are hosted here at our main organization's Github to make it easier on me for monitoring the project mgmt, etc.,

The internship for AI/ML/DL/Data Science related stuff is really more associated with our child corp: [SERP AI](https://github.com/serp-ai).

Either way, at conclusion all the work you do will be shareable to potential employers, your portfolio, etc.


## Overview (Data Science)
This program is a collaborative effort between all accepted interns to provide a real-world opportunity to build something of value for a real company that can be added to your portfolio, LinkedIn profiles, and help you in your careers.

It is an opportunity to learn new skills & improve your current abilities while working on real projects with a team - just like you will do in the real world in your career - with low pressure and stress.

You will learn to work collaboratively & asynchronously with other developers using best practices in software design & development, and collaborative Git workflows.

The focus will be on DATA.

Whether you plan to be a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, AI Researcher, or otherwise -- the fundamentals of understanding how to setup ETL/ELT/EtLT pipelines to take real-world "dirty" data and turn it into clean, useable data that can drive real business value is indispensible.


## Benefits
- Experience working on real-life projects & collaborating with other developers on projects
- Official team membership for your LinkedIn profile
- Projects to add to your portfolio
- Letter of recommendation from the founder upon successful completion

## Team Collaboration & How To Work Together
ðŸ‘‰ Click here to read our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](https://github.com/serpcompany/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

I plan to have this open to everyone who is interested in participating, so you can get experience working with a team, contributing to a project in a quasi "open source software" manner (even though it's not actually open source I think this will be a good sim). 

At SERP AI we believe in bringing artificial intelligence, software development & online education to as many people as possible - regardless of race, religion, geography, gender or financial status - so I belive full inclusion is the right approach.


## Whats Next?
More information & tasks to come soon... 

For now, go ahead and introduce yourself in the Discussions area and stay tuned for updates coming soon, and get acquianted with the various resources, etc. mentioned above.

Cheers!
